# Dataquest Repository

As I work through the Dataquest.io Data Scientist Path, I will be adding the code lessons here. Any projects will have their own individual repositories, as those are generally using Jupyter Notebook.

I also hope to write any quirks I run into with some of these lessons, as there are a few errors here and there but most are easy to overcome.
